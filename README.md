# Webpack JavaScript Project Template

This is a JavaScript implementation of the classic Battleship game. The goal of the game is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours. The game is played on a grid, with players taking turns to target and hit their opponentâ€™s ships.

This project is built using modern JavaScript (ES6 modules) along with Webpack for bundling. It also includes unit testing using Jest, making sure the core logic is reliable and thoroughly tested.
